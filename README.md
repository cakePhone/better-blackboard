## Contributing

Guidelines on contribution are yet to be made, but for now follow this:

- Never commit to main directly. On your fork (or this repo), please create a new branch.

- Describe what you're trying to implement and why in your PRs.

As always, to start contributing, clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/cakePhone/better-blackboard.git
```

Make a new branch for your desired feature:

```
git branch <name_of_your_branch>
git checkout <name_of_your_branch>
```

And code from there.
